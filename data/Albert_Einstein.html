<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Physics_in_1900">Physics in 1900</span></h3>
<p>Einstein&acirc;Äôs early papers all come from attempts to demonstrate that atoms exist and have a finite nonzero size. At the time of his first paper in 1902, it was not yet completely accepted by physicists that atoms were real, even though chemists had good evidence ever since <a href="/wiki/Antoine_Lavoisier" title="Antoine Lavoisier">Antoine Lavoisier</a>&acirc;Äôs work a century earlier. The reason physicists were skeptical was because no 19th century theory could fully explain the properties of matter from the properties of atoms.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Ludwig_Boltzmann" title="Ludwig Boltzmann">Ludwig Boltzmann</a> was a leading 19th century atomist physicist, who had struggled for years to gain acceptance for atoms. Boltzmann had given an interpretation of the laws of thermodynamics, suggesting that the law of entropy increase is statistical. In Boltzmann&acirc;Äôs way of thinking, the entropy is the logarithm of the number of ways a system could be configured inside. The reason the entropy goes up is only because it is more likely for a system to go from a special state with only a few possible internal configurations to a more generic state with many. While Boltzmann&acirc;Äôs statistical interpretation of entropy is universally accepted today, and Einstein believed it, at the turn of the 20th century it was a minority position.</p>
<p>The statistical idea was most successful in explaining the properties of gases. <a href="/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell" title="James Clerk Maxwell">James Clerk Maxwell</a>, another leading atomist, had found the distribution of velocities of atoms in a gas, and derived the surprising result that the <a href="/wiki/Viscosity" title="Viscosity">viscosity</a> of a gas should be independent of density. Intuitively, the friction in a gas would seem to go to zero as the density goes to zero, but this is not so, because the <a href="/wiki/Mean_free_path" title="Mean free path">mean free path</a> of atoms becomes large at low densities. A subsequent experiment by Maxwell and his wife confirmed this surprising prediction. Other experiments on gases and vacuum, using a rotating slitted drum, showed that atoms in a gas had velocities distributed according to Maxwell&acirc;Äôs distribution law.</p>
<p>In addition to these successes, there were also inconsistencies. Maxwell noted that at cold temperatures, atomic theory predicted specific heats that are too large. In classical <a href="/wiki/Statistical_mechanics" title="Statistical mechanics">statistical mechanics</a>, every <a href="/wiki/Simple_harmonic_oscillator" title="Simple harmonic oscillator" class="mw-redirect">spring-like motion</a> has thermal energy <i>k</i><sub>B</sub><i>T</i> on average at temperature <i>T</i>, so that the <a href="/wiki/Specific_heat" title="Specific heat" class="mw-redirect">specific heat</a> of every spring is <a href="/wiki/Boltzmann%E2%80%99s_constant" title="Boltzmann&acirc;Äôs constant" class="mw-redirect">Boltzmann&acirc;Äôs constant</a> <i>k</i><sub>B</sub>. A monatomic solid with <i>N</i> atoms can be thought of as <i>N</i> little balls representing <i>N</i> atoms attached to each other in a box grid with 3<i>N</i> springs, so the specific heat of every solid is 3<i>Nk</i><sub>B</sub>, a result which became known as the <a href="/wiki/Dulong%E2%80%93Petit_law" title="Dulong&acirc;ÄìPetit law">Dulong&acirc;ÄìPetit law</a>. This law is true at room temperature, but not for colder temperatures. At temperatures near zero, the specific heat goes to zero.</p>
<p>Similarly, a gas made up of a molecule with two atoms can be thought of as two balls on a spring. This spring has energy <i>k</i><sub>B</sub><i>T</i> at high temperatures, and should contribute an extra <i>k</i><sub>B</sub> to the specific heat. It does at temperatures of about 1000 degrees, but at lower temperature, this contribution disappears. At zero temperature, all other contributions to the specific heat from rotations and vibrations also disappear. This behavior was inconsistent with classical physics.</p>
<p>The most glaring inconsistency was in the theory of light waves. Continuous waves in a box can be thought of as infinitely many spring-like motions, one for each possible <a href="/wiki/Standing_wave" title="Standing wave">standing wave</a>. Each standing wave has a specific heat of <i>k</i><sub>B</sub>, so the total specific heat of a continuous wave like light should be infinite in classical mechanics. This is obviously wrong, because it would mean that all energy in the universe would be instantly sucked up into light waves, and everything would slow down and stop.</p>
<p>These inconsistencies led some people to say that atoms were not physical, but mathematical. Notable among the skeptics was <a href="/wiki/Ernst_Mach" title="Ernst Mach">Ernst Mach</a>, whose positivist philosophy led him to demand that if atoms are real, it should be possible to see them directly.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup> Mach believed that atoms were a useful fiction, that in reality they could be assumed to be infinitesimally small, that <a href="/wiki/Avogadro%E2%80%99s_number" title="Avogadro&acirc;Äôs number" class="mw-redirect">Avogadro&acirc;Äôs number</a> was infinite, or so large that it might as well be infinite, and <i>k</i><sub>B</sub> was infinitesimally small. Certain experiments could then be explained by atomic theory, but other experiments could not, and this is the way it will always be.</p>
<p>Einstein opposed this position. Throughout his career, he was a realist. He believed that a single consistent theory should explain all observation, and that this theory would be a description what was really going on, underneath it all. So he set out to show that the atomic point of view was correct. This led him first to thermodynamics, then to statistical physics, and to the theory of specific heats of solids.</p>
<p>In 1905, while he was working in the patent office, the leading German language physics journal <i><a href="/wiki/Annalen_der_Physik" title="Annalen der Physik">Annalen der Physik</a></i> published four of Einstein&acirc;Äôs papers. The four papers eventually were recognized as revolutionary, and 1905 became known as Einstein&acirc;Äôs &quot;<a href="/wiki/Annus_mirabilis" title="Annus mirabilis">Miracle Year</a>&quot;, and the papers, as the <i><a href="/wiki/Annus_Mirabilis_Papers" title="Annus Mirabilis Papers" class="mw-redirect">Annus Mirabilis Papers</a>.</i></p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Thermodynamic_fluctuations_and_statistical_physics">Thermodynamic fluctuations and statistical physics</span></h3>

<p>Einstein&acirc;Äôs earliest papers were concerned with <a href="/wiki/Thermodynamics" title="Thermodynamics">thermodynamics</a>. He wrote a paper establishing a <a href="/w/index.php?title=Thermodynamic_identity&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Thermodynamic identity (page does not exist)">thermodynamic identity</a> in 1902, and a few other papers which attempted to interpret phenomena from a statistical atomic point of view.</p>
<p>His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena. As in Maxwell&acirc;Äôs work, the finite nonzero size of atoms leads to effects which can be observed. This research, and the thermodynamic identity, were well within the mainstream of physics in his time. They would eventually form the content of his PhD thesis.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>His first major result in this field was the theory of thermodynamic fluctuations. When in equilibrium, a system has a maximum entropy and according to the statistical interpretation, it can fluctuate a little bit. Einstein pointed out that the statistical fluctuations of a macroscopic object, like a mirror suspended on spring, would be completely determined by the second derivative of the entropy with respect to the position of the mirror.</p>
<p>Searching for ways to test this relation, his great breakthrough came in 1905. The theory of fluctuations, he realized, would have a visible effect for an object which could move around freely. Such an object would have a velocity which is random, and would move around randomly, just like an individual atom. The average kinetic energy of the object would be <span class="texhtml"><i>k</i><sub><i>B</i></sub><i>T</i></span>, and the time decay of the fluctuations would be entirely determined by the law of friction.</p>
<p>The law of friction for a small ball in a viscous fluid like water was discovered by <a href="/wiki/Sir_George_Stokes,_1st_Baronet" title="Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet">George Stokes</a>. He showed that for small velocities, the friction force would be proportional to the velocity, and to the radius of the particle (see <a href="/wiki/Stokes%E2%80%99_law" title="Stokes&acirc;Äô law" class="mw-redirect">Stokes&acirc;Äô law</a>). This relation could be used to calculate how far a small ball in water would travel due to its random thermal motion, and Einstein noted that such a ball, of size about a <a href="/wiki/Micron" title="Micron" class="mw-redirect">micron</a>, would travel about a few microns per second. This motion could be easily detected with a microscope and indeed, as <a href="/wiki/Brownian_motion" title="Brownian motion">Brownian motion</a>, had actually been observed by the botanist <a href="/wiki/Robert_Brown_(botanist)" title="Robert Brown (botanist)">Robert Brown</a>. Einstein was able to identify this motion with that predicted by his theory. Since the fluctuations which give rise to Brownian motion are just the same as the fluctuations of the velocities of atoms, measuring the precise amount of Brownian motion using Einstein&acirc;Äôs theory would show that Boltzmann&acirc;Äôs constant is non-zero and would measure Avogadro&acirc;Äôs number.</p>
<p>These experiments were carried out a few years later, and gave a rough estimate of Avogadro&acirc;Äôs number consistent with the more accurate estimates due to <a href="/wiki/Max_Planck" title="Max Planck">Max Planck</a>&acirc;Äôs theory of blackbody light, and <a href="/wiki/Robert_Millikan" title="Robert Millikan" class="mw-redirect">Robert Millikan</a>&acirc;Äôs measurement of the charge of the electron.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33"><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup> Unlike the other methods, Einstein&acirc;Äôs required very few theoretical assumptions or new physics, since it was directly measuring atomic motion on visible grains.</p>
<p>Einstein&acirc;Äôs theory of Brownian motion was the first paper in the field of <a href="/wiki/Statistical_physics" title="Statistical physics">statistical physics</a>. It established that thermodynamic fluctuations were related to dissipation. This was shown by Einstein to be true for time-independent fluctuations, but in the Brownian motion paper he showed that dynamical relaxation rates calculated from classical mechanics could be used as statistical relaxation rates to derive dynamical diffusion laws. These relations are known as <a href="/wiki/Einstein_relation_(kinetic_theory)" title="Einstein relation (kinetic theory)">Einstein relations</a>.</p>
<p>The theory of Brownian motion was the least revolutionary of Einstein&acirc;Äôs <a href="/wiki/Annus_mirabilis" title="Annus mirabilis">Annus mirabilis</a> papers, but it had an important role in securing the acceptance of the atomic theory by physicists.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Thought_experiments_and_a-priori_physical_principles">Thought experiments and a-priori physical principles</span></h3>

<p>Einstein&acirc;Äôs thinking underwent a transformation in 1905. He had come to understand that quantum properties of light mean that Maxwell&acirc;Äôs equations were only an approximation. He knew that new laws would have to replace these, but he did not know how to go about finding those laws. He felt that guessing formal relations would not go anywhere.</p>
<p>So he decided to focus on a-priori principles instead, which are statements about physical laws which can be understood to hold in a very broad sense even in domains where they have not yet been shown to apply. A well accepted example of an a-priori principle is <a href="/wiki/Rotational_invariance" title="Rotational invariance">rotational invariance</a>. If a new force is discovered in physics, it is assumed to be rotationally invariant almost automatically, without thought. Einstein sought new principles of this sort, to guide the production of physical ideas. Once enough principles are found, then the new physics will be the simplest theory consistent with the principles and with previously known laws.</p>
<p>The first general a-priori principle he found was the <a href="/wiki/Principle_of_relativity" title="Principle of relativity">principle of relativity</a>, that uniform motion is indistinguishable from rest. This was understood by Hermann Minkowski to be a generalization of rotational invariance from space to space-time. Other principles postulated by Einstein and later vindicated, are the <a href="/wiki/Principle_of_equivalence" title="Principle of equivalence" class="mw-redirect">principle of equivalence</a> and the principle of <a href="/wiki/Adiabatic_invariant" title="Adiabatic invariant">adiabatic invariance</a> of the quantum number. Another of Einstein&acirc;Äôs general principles, <a href="/wiki/Mach%E2%80%99s_principle" title="Mach&acirc;Äôs principle" class="mw-redirect">Mach&acirc;Äôs principle</a> is fiercely debated, and whether it holds in our world or not is still not definitively established.</p>
<p>The use of a-priori principles is a distinctive unique signature of Einstein&acirc;Äôs early work, which has become a standard tool in modern theoretical physics.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Special_relativity">Special relativity</span></h3>

<p>His 1905 paper on the <a href="/wiki/Electrodynamics" title="Electrodynamics" class="mw-redirect">electrodynamics</a> of moving bodies introduced his theory of <a href="/wiki/Special_relativity" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a>, which showed that the observed independence of the <a href="/wiki/Speed_of_light" title="Speed of light">speed of light</a> on the observer&acirc;Äôs state of motion required fundamental changes to the <a href="/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity" title="Relativity of simultaneity">notion of simultaneity</a>.

<p>In a 1905 paper,<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40"><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup> Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles (<i>quanta</i>). Einstein&acirc;Äôs light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including <a href="/wiki/Max_Planck" title="Max Planck">Max Planck</a> and <a href="/wiki/Niels_Bohr" title="Niels Bohr">Niels Bohr</a>. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with <a href="/wiki/Robert_Millikan" title="Robert Millikan" class="mw-redirect">Robert Millikan</a>&acirc;Äôs detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of <a href="/wiki/Compton_scattering" title="Compton scattering">Compton scattering</a>.</p>
<p>Einstein&acirc;Äôs paper on the light particles was almost entirely motivated by thermodynamic considerations. He was not at all motivated by the detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, which did not confirm his theory until fifteen years later. Einstein considers the entropy of light at temperature <i>T</i>, and decomposes it into a low-frequency part and a high-frequency part. The high-frequency part, where the light is described by <a href="/wiki/Wien_approximation" title="Wien approximation">Wien&acirc;Äôs law</a>, has an entropy which looks exactly the same as the entropy of a gas of classical particles.</p>
<p>Since the entropy is the logarithm of the number of possible states, Einstein concludes that the number of states of short wavelength light waves in a box with volume <i>V</i> is equal to the number of states of a group of localizable particles in the same box. Since (unlike others) he was comfortable with the statistical interpretation, he confidently postulates that the light itself is made up of localized particles, as this is the only reasonable interpretation of the entropy.</p>
<p>This leads him to conclude that each wave of frequency <i>f</i> is associated with a collection of <a href="/wiki/Photon" title="Photon">photons</a> with energy <i>hf</i> each, where <i>h</i> is <a href="/wiki/Planck%E2%80%99s_constant" title="Planck&acirc;Äôs constant" class="mw-redirect">Planck&acirc;Äôs constant</a>. He does not say much more, because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave. But he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the <a href="/wiki/Photoelectric_effect" title="Photoelectric effect">photoelectric effect</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41"><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Quantized_atomic_vibrations">Quantized atomic vibrations</span></h3>

<p>Einstein continued his work on quantum mechanics in 1906, by explaining the specific heat anomaly in solids. This was the first application of quantum theory to a mechanical system. Since Planck&acirc;Äôs distribution for light oscillators had no problem with infinite specific heats, the same idea could be applied to solids to fix the specific heat problem there. Einstein showed in a <a href="/wiki/Einstein_solid" title="Einstein solid">simple model</a> that the hypothesis that solid motion is quantized explains why the specific heat of a solid goes to zero at zero temperature.</p>
<p>Einstein&acirc;Äôs model treats each atom as connected to a single spring. Instead of connecting all the atoms to each other, which leads to standing waves with all sorts of different frequencies, Einstein imagined that each atom was attached to a fixed point in space by a spring. This is not physically correct, but it still predicts that the specific heat is 3<i>Nk</i><sub>B</sub>, since the number of independent oscillations stays the same.</p>
<p>Einstein then assumes that the motion in this model are quantized, according to the Planck law, so that each independent spring motion has energy which is an integer multiple of hf, where f is the frequency of oscillation. With this assumption, he applied Boltzmann&acirc;Äôs statistical method to calculate the average energy of the spring. The result was the same as the one that Planck had derived for light: for temperatures where <i>k</i><sub>B</sub><i>T</i> is much smaller than <i>hf</i>, the motion is frozen, and the specific heat goes to zero.</p>
<p>So Einstein concluded that quantum mechanics would solve the main problem of classical physics, the specific heat anomaly. The particles of sound implied by this formulation are now called <a href="/wiki/Phonon" title="Phonon">phonons</a>. Because all of Einstein&acirc;Äôs springs have the same stiffness, they all freeze out at the same temperature, and this leads to a prediction that the specific heat should go to zero exponentially fast when the temperature is low. The solution to this problem is to solve for the independent <a href="/wiki/Normal_modes" title="Normal modes" class="mw-redirect">normal modes</a> individually, and to quantize those. Then each normal mode has a different frequency, and long wavelength vibration modes freeze out at colder temperatures than short wavelength ones. This was done by <a href="/wiki/Debye" title="Debye">Debye</a>, and after this modification, Einstein&acirc;Äôs quantization method reproduced quantitatively the behavior of the specific heats of solids at low temperatures.</p>

<p>Throughout the 1910s, quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems. After <a href="/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford" title="Ernest Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a> discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, <a href="/wiki/Niels_Bohr" title="Niels Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the <a href="/wiki/Periodic_table_of_the_elements" title="Periodic table of the elements" class="mw-redirect">periodic table of the elements</a>.</p>
<p>Einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments <a href="/wiki/Wilhelm_Wien" title="Wilhelm Wien">Wilhelm Wien</a> had made. Wien had shown that the hypothesis of <a href="/wiki/Adiabatic_invariant" title="Adiabatic invariant">adiabatic invariance</a> of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the <a href="/wiki/Blackbody_radiation" title="Blackbody radiation" class="mw-redirect">blackbody curves</a> at different temperature to be derived from one another by a <a href="/wiki/Wien%E2%80%99s_displacement_law" title="Wien&acirc;Äôs displacement law" class="mw-redirect">simple shifting process</a>. Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. <a href="/wiki/Arnold_Sommerfeld" title="Arnold Sommerfeld">Arnold Sommerfeld</a> identified this adiabatic invariant as the <a href="/wiki/Action-angle_variables" title="Action-angle variables" class="mw-redirect">action variable</a> of classical mechanics.

<p>Einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to <a href="/wiki/Raleigh_scattering" title="Raleigh scattering" class="mw-redirect">Raleigh scattering</a>, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue.<sup id="cite_ref-Levenson_43-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Levenson-43"><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Zero-point_energy">Zero-point energy</span></h3>

<p>Einstein&acirc;Äôs physical intuition led him to note that Planck&acirc;Äôs oscillator energies had an incorrect zero point. He modified Planck&acirc;Äôs hypothesis by stating that the lowest energy state of an oscillator is equal to <span style="white-space:nowrap" class="template-frac"><sup>1</sup><big>&acirc;ÅÑ</big><sub>2</sub></span><i>hf</i>, to half the energy spacing between levels. This argument, which was made in 1913 in collaboration with <a href="/wiki/Otto_Stern" title="Otto Stern">Otto Stern</a>, was based on the thermodynamics of a diatomic molecule which can split apart into two free atoms.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Principle_of_equivalence">Principle of equivalence</span></h3>

<p>In 1907, while still working at the patent office, Einstein had what he would call his &quot;happiest thought&quot;. He realized that the principle of relativity could be extended to gravitational fields. He thought about the case of a uniformly accelerated box not in a gravitational field, and noted that it would be indistinguishable from a box sitting still in an unchanging gravitational field.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44"><span>[</span>45<span>]</span></a></sup> He used special relativity to see that the rate of clocks at the top of a box accelerating upward would be faster than the rate of clocks at the bottom. He concludes that the rates of clocks depend on their position in a gravitational field, and that the difference in rate is proportional to the gravitational potential to first approximation.</p>
<p>Although this approximation is crude, it allowed him to calculate the deflection of light by gravity, and show that it is nonzero. This gave him confidence that the scalar theory of gravity proposed by <a href="/wiki/Gunnar_Nordstr%C3%B6m" title="Gunnar Nordstr&Atilde;&para;m">Gunnar Nordstr&Atilde;&para;m</a> was incorrect. But the actual value for the deflection that he calculated was too small by a factor of two, because the approximation he used doesn&acirc;Äôt work well for things moving at near the speed of light. When Einstein finished the full theory of general relativity, he would rectify this error, and predict the correct amount of light deflection by the sun.</p>
<p>From Prague, Einstein published a paper about the effects of gravity on light, specifically the <a href="/wiki/Gravitational_redshift" title="Gravitational redshift">gravitational redshift</a> and the gravitational deflection of light. The paper challenged astronomers to detect the deflection during a <a href="/wiki/Solar_eclipse" title="Solar eclipse">solar eclipse</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45"><span>[</span>46<span>]</span></a></sup> German astronomer <a href="/wiki/Erwin_Finlay-Freundlich" title="Erwin Finlay-Freundlich">Erwin Finlay-Freundlich</a> publicized Einstein&acirc;Äôs challenge to scientists around the world.<sup id="cite_ref-Crelinston_1_46-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Crelinston_1-46"><span>[</span>47<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Einstein thought about the nature of the gravitational field in the years 1909&acirc;Äì1912, studying its properties by means of simple thought experiments. A notable one is the rotating disk. Einstein imagined an observer making experiments on a rotating turntable. He noted that such an observer would find a different value for the mathematical constant pi than the one predicted by Euclidean geometry. The reason is that the radius of a circle would be measured with an uncontracted ruler, but according to special relativity, the circumference would seem to be longer, because the ruler would be contracted.</p>
<p>Since Einstein believed that the laws of physics were local, described by local fields, he concluded from this that spacetime could be locally curved. This led him to study <a href="/wiki/Riemannian_geometry" title="Riemannian geometry">Riemannian geometry</a>, and to formulate general relativity in this language.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hole_argument_and_Entwurf_theory">Hole argument and Entwurf theory</span></h3>

<p>While developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the <a href="/wiki/Gauge_invariance" title="Gauge invariance" class="mw-redirect">gauge invariance</a> in the theory. He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible. He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations, and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.</p>
<p>The Entwurf (&quot;draft&quot;) theory was the result of these investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. Simultaneously less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, Einstein abandoned the theory after realizing that the hole argument was mistaken.</p>

<p>General relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. <a href="/wiki/Noether%E2%80%99s_theorem" title="Noether&acirc;Äôs theorem" class="mw-redirect">Noether&acirc;Äôs theorem</a> allows these quantities to be determined from a <a href="/wiki/Lagrangian" title="Lagrangian">Lagrangian</a> with <a href="/wiki/Translational_symmetry" title="Translational symmetry">translation invariance</a>, but <a href="/wiki/General_covariance" title="General covariance">general covariance</a> makes translation invariance into something of a <a href="/wiki/Gauge_symmetry" title="Gauge symmetry">gauge symmetry</a>.

In 1950, he described his &quot;<a href="/wiki/Unified_field_theory" title="Unified field theory">unified field theory</a>&quot; in a <i><a href="/wiki/Scientific_American" title="Scientific American">Scientific American</a></i> article entitled &quot;On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation.&quot; <sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-63"><span>[</span>64<span>]</span></a></sup> Although he continued to be lauded for his work, Einstein became increasingly isolated in his research, and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. In his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics, most notably the <a href="/wiki/Strong_nuclear_force" title="Strong nuclear force" class="mw-redirect">strong</a> and <a href="/wiki/Weak_nuclear_force" title="Weak nuclear force" class="mw-redirect">weak nuclear forces</a>, which were not well understood until many years after his death. Mainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein&acirc;Äôs approaches to unification. Einstein&acirc;Äôs dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a <a href="/wiki/Theory_of_everything" title="Theory of everything">theory of everything</a> and in particular <a href="/wiki/String_theory" title="String theory">string theory</a>, where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Wormholes">Wormholes</span></h3>

<p>Einstein collaborated with others to produce a model of a <a href="/wiki/Wormhole" title="Wormhole">wormhole</a>. His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper &quot;Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles?&quot;. These solutions cut and pasted <a href="/wiki/Schwarzschild_black_hole" title="Schwarzschild black hole" class="mw-redirect">Schwarzschild black holes</a> to make a bridge between two patches.</p>
<p>If one end of a wormhole was positively charged, the other end would be negatively charged. These properties led Einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Einstein.E2.80.93Cartan_theory">Einstein&acirc;ÄìCartan theory</span></h3>

<p>In order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the <a href="/wiki/Torsion" title="Torsion">torsion</a>. This modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Einstein.E2.80.93Podolsky.E2.80.93Rosen_paradox">Einstein&acirc;ÄìPodolsky&acirc;ÄìRosen paradox</span></h3>

<p>In 1935, Einstein returned to the question of quantum mechanics. He considered how a measurement on one of two entangled particles would affect the other. He noted, along with his collaborators, that by performing different measurements on the distant particle, either of position or momentum, different properties of the entangled partner could be discovered without disturbing it in any way.</p>
<p>He then used a hypothesis of <a href="/wiki/Local_realism" title="Local realism" class="mw-redirect">local realism</a> to conclude that the other particle had these properties already determined. The principle he proposed is that if it is possible to determine what the answer to a position or momentum measurement would be, without in any way disturbing the particle, then the particle actually has values of position or momentum.</p>
<p>This principle distilled the essence of Einstein&acirc;Äôs objection to quantum mechanics. As a physical principle, it has since been shown to be incompatible with experiments.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Equations_of_motion">Equations of motion</span></h3>

<p>The theory of general relativity has two fundamental laws&nbsp;&acirc;Äì the <a href="/wiki/Einstein_equations" title="Einstein equations" class="mw-redirect">Einstein equations</a> which describe how space curves, and the <a href="/wiki/Geodesic_equation" title="Geodesic equation" class="mw-redirect">geodesic equation</a> which describes how particles move.</p>
<p>Since the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined by the Einstein equations themselves, not by a new law. So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.</p>
<p>This was established by Einstein, Infeld and Hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum, and by <a href="/wiki/Roy_Kerr" title="Roy Kerr">Roy Kerr</a> for spinning objects.</p>

<p>In addition to his well-accepted results, some of Einstein&acirc;Äôs papers contain mistakes:</p>
<ul>
<li>1905: In the original German version of the special relativity paper, and in some English translations, Einstein gives a wrong expression for the transverse mass of a fast moving particle. The transverse mass is the antiquated name for the ratio of the 3-force to the 3-acceleration when the force is perpendicular to the velocity. Einstein gives this ratio as , while the actual value is  (corrected by Max Planck).</li>
<li>1905: In his PhD dissertation, the friction in dilute solutions has a miscalculated numerical prefactor, which makes the estimate of Avogadro&acirc;Äôs number off by a factor of 3. The mistake is corrected by Einstein in a later publication.</li>
<li>1905: An expository paper explaining how airplanes fly includes an example which is incorrect. There is a wing which he claims will generate lift. This wing is flat on the bottom, and flat on the top, with a small bump at the center. It is designed to generate lift by <a href="/wiki/Bernoulli%E2%80%99s_principle" title="Bernoulli&acirc;Äôs principle" class="mw-redirect">Bernoulli&acirc;Äôs principle</a>, and Einstein claims that it will. Simple action reaction considerations, though, show that the wing will not generate lift, at least if it is long enough.</li>
<li>1911: Einstein predicted how much the sun&acirc;Äôs gravity would deflect nearby starlight, but used an approximation which gives an answer which is half as big as the correct one.<sup id="cite_ref-Wright_64-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Wright-64"><span>[</span>65<span>]</span></a></sup></li>
<li>1913: Einstein started writing papers based on his belief that the <a href="/wiki/Hole_argument" title="Hole argument">hole argument</a> made general covariance impossible in a theory of gravity.</li>
<li>1922: Einstein published a qualitative theory of superconductivity based on the vague idea of electrons shared in orbits. This paper predated modern quantum mechanics, and is well understood to be completely wrong. The correct <a href="/wiki/BCS_theory" title="BCS theory">BCS theory</a> of low temperature superconductivity was only worked out in 1957, thirty years after the establishing of modern quantum mechanics.</li>
<li>1937: Einstein believed that the focusing properties of geodesics in general relativity would lead to an instability which causes plane gravitational waves to collapse in on themselves. While this is true to a certain extent in some limits, because gravitational instabilities can lead to a concentration of energy density into black holes, for plane waves of the type Einstein and Rosen considered in their paper, the instabilities are under control. Einstein retracted this position a short time later, but until his death his collaborator <a href="/wiki/Nathan_Rosen" title="Nathan Rosen">Nathan Rosen</a> maintained that gravitational waves are unstable.</li>
<li>1939: Einstein denied several times that black holes could form, the last time in print. He published a paper that argues that a star collapsing would spin faster and faster, spinning at the speed of light with infinite energy well before the point where it is about to collapse into a black hole. This paper received no citations, and the conclusions are well understood to be wrong. Einstein&acirc;Äôs argument itself is inconclusive, since he only shows that stable spinning objects have to spin faster and faster to stay stable before the point where they collapse. But it is well understood today (and was understood well by some even then) that collapse cannot happen through stationary states the way Einstein imagined.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these well established mistakes, there are other arguments whose deduction is considered correct, but whose interpretation or philosophical conclusion is considered to have been incorrect:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <a href="/wiki/Bohr%E2%80%93Einstein_debates" title="Bohr&acirc;ÄìEinstein debates">Bohr&acirc;ÄìEinstein debates</a> and the papers following this, Einstein tries to poke holes in the uncertainty principle, ingeniously, but unsuccessfully.</li>
<li>In the <a href="/wiki/EPR_paradox" title="EPR paradox">EPR paper</a>, Einstein concludes that quantum mechanics must be replaced by local hidden variables. The measured violations of <a href="/wiki/Bell%E2%80%99s_inequality" title="Bell&acirc;Äôs inequality" class="mw-redirect">Bell&acirc;Äôs inequality</a> show that hidden variables, if they exist, must be nonlocal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Einstein himself considered the use of the &quot;fudge factor&quot; lambda in his 1917 paper founding cosmology as a &quot;blunder&quot;.<sup id="cite_ref-Wright_64-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Wright-64"><span>[</span>65<span>]</span></a></sup> The theory of general relativity predicted an expanding or contracting universe, but Einstein wanted a universe which is an unchanging three dimensional sphere, like the surface of a three dimensional ball in four dimensions. He wanted this for philosophical reasons, so as to incorporate <a href="/wiki/Mach%E2%80%99s_principle" title="Mach&acirc;Äôs principle" class="mw-redirect">Mach&acirc;Äôs principle</a> in a reasonable way. He stabilized his solution by introducing a <a href="/wiki/Cosmological_constant" title="Cosmological constant">cosmological constant</a>, and when the universe was shown to be expanding, he retracted the constant as a blunder. This is not really much of a blunder&nbsp;&acirc;Äì the cosmological constant is necessary within general relativity as it is currently understood, and it is widely believed to have a nonzero value today. Einstein took the wrong side in a few scientific debates.</p>
<ul>
<li>He briefly flirted with transverse and longitudinal mass concepts, before rejecting them.</li>
<li>Einstein initially opposed Minkowski&acirc;Äôs geometrical formulation of special relativity, changing his mind completely a few years later.</li>
<li>Based on his cosmological model, Einstein rejected expanding universe solutions by <a href="/wiki/Friedman" title="Friedman">Friedman</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lemaitre" title="Lemaitre" class="mw-redirect">Lemaitre</a> as unphysical, changing his mind when the universe was shown to be expanding a few years later.</li>
<li>Finding it too formal, Einstein believed that Heisenberg&acirc;Äôs <a href="/wiki/Matrix_mechanics" title="Matrix mechanics">matrix mechanics</a> was incorrect. He changed his mind when Schr&Atilde;&para;dinger and others demonstrated that the formulation in terms of the <a href="/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation" title="Schr&Atilde;&para;dinger equation">Schr&Atilde;&para;dinger equation</a>, based on Einstein&acirc;Äôs <a href="/wiki/Wave-particle_duality" title="Wave-particle duality" class="mw-redirect">wave-particle duality</a> was equivalent to Heisenberg&acirc;Äôs matrices.</li>
<li>Einstein rejected work on black holes<sup id="cite_ref-Wright2_65-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Wright2-65"><span>[</span>66<span>]</span></a></sup> by <a href="/wiki/Subrahmanyan_Chandrasekhar" title="Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar">Chandrasekhar</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oppenheimer" title="Oppenheimer">Oppenheimer</a>, and others, believing, along with Eddington, that collapse past the horizon (then called the &acirc;Äô<a href="/wiki/Event_horizon" title="Event horizon">Schwarzschild singularity</a>&acirc;Äô) would never happen. So big was his influence, that this opinion was not rejected until the early 1960s, almost a decade after his death.</li>
<li>Einstein believed that some sort of nonlinear instability could lead to a field theory whose solutions would collapse into pointlike objects which would behave like quantum particles. While there are many field theories with point-like particle solutions, none of them behave like quantum particles. It is widely believed that quantum mechanics would be impossible to reproduce from a local field theory of the type Einstein considered, because of <a href="/wiki/Bell%E2%80%99s_inequality" title="Bell&acirc;Äôs inequality" class="mw-redirect">Bell&acirc;Äôs inequality</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these well known mistakes, it is sometimes claimed that the general line of Einstein&acirc;Äôs reasoning in the 1905 relativity paper is flawed, or the photon paper, or one or another of the most famous papers. None of these claims are widely accepted.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Einstein-de_Haas_experiment">Einstein-de Haas experiment</span></h3>

<p>Einstein and De Haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin. In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a <a href="/wiki/Torsion_pendulum" title="Torsion pendulum" class="mw-redirect">torsion pendulum</a>. They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron&acirc;Äôs angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes. This experiment needed to be sensitive, because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Schr.C3.B6dinger_gas_model">Schr&Atilde;&para;dinger gas model</span></h3>

This refers to his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect, &quot;On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light&quot;, which was well supported by the experimental evidence by that time. The presentation speech began by mentioning &quot;his theory of relativity [which had] been the subject of lively debate in philosophical circles [and] also has astrophysical implications which are being rigorously examined at the present time.&quot; (<a href="#CITEREFEinstein1923">Einstein 1923</a>)</p>

<p>Einstein traveled to New York City in the United States for the first time on 2 April 1921. When asked where he got his scientific ideas, Einstein explained that he believed scientific work best proceeds from an examination of physical reality and a search for underlying axioms, with consistent explanations that apply in all instances and avoid contradicting each other. He also recommended theories with visualizable results (<a href="#CITEREFEinstein1954">Einstein 1954</a>).<sup id="cite_ref-101" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-101"><span>[</span>102<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
